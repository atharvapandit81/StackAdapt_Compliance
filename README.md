# StackAdapt_Compliance
This project is to check whether an image is complaint with the StackAdpats rules and regulations
(You might have to edit the details about the path of the image as I have first run this on my jupyter notebook but the code works)
# This code has much bigger implications and I am just trying to bridge the gap between the PQ and the Account Executive team at StackAdapt.
